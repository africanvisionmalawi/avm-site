Thanks to Seeds for Africa for donating funds for our reforestation programme which started by planting fruit trees in some of our schools and then went into setting up wood lots at our schools. A private donor at Seeds for Africa also provided funding for fruit trees at our Community Based Childcare Centres.

We have been planting hundreds of trees since February 2008 and the trees from our early gardens in Chitsime, Masiye and M’bang’ombe are thriving.

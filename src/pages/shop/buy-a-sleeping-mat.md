**A Christmas Present to make a difference**

Do consider making a donation to Sam's Village as a gift to your loved ones.

We will send you a gift card which you can personalise and pass on as your present.

When you donate, please mention 'Christmas Present' in your message and of course your address.

'Sam''s Village supports marginalised students through a 4-month vocational
training programme. At the end they come out as accredited carpenters, tailors,
mechanics etc. We also give them around £100 of tools to get them started and orders
to get them off the ground. £100 goes towards the cost of this, but any amount can
be donated by just clicking the Donate button. If you mention "Sam''s Village Christmas
Present" and leave your address we will post you gift card too! '

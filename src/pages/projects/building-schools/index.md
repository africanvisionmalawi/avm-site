A School for Masiye

Back in 2006, the very first project of African Vision Malawi was to build a school for Masiye village. This project improved vastly on the original grass roofed structure and included school blocks, teachers’ houses, a kitchen, a store room and renovation of the pre-school.

Here you can see photos of the initial building work, and of the completed school:

Project4Africa is a group who raise funds to help various projects in Africa. Over the years – since 2009 – we have worked with them on a number of projects.

Projects carried out together include:

At Namanyanga (in the north-east of our area):

    2 school blocks
    a pre-school (Community Based Children’s centre)
    a teacher’s house

At M’bang’ombe:

    the Maternity Unit
    a new roof for the Maternity Unit staff accommodation after it was blown off

In 2015 some of the Project4Africa team made a trip from the UK to Malawi to visit the completed Maternity Unit. In fact, a baby was born while they were there!

It has also become a tradition to hold a Project4Africa v. Namanyanga School football match as often as possible!

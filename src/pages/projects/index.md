    is a huge issue with lack of transport to hospital/clinics. There are not enough

    centre is huge.

    want to go on and get a full education (and hopefully go onto university) it costs
    around £792 for four years at Secondary School This pays for school fees, exam
    fees, school materials, boarding fees, food and school uniform. We are currently
    sponsoring 28 teenagers to go to Secondary school.

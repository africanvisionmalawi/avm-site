      Bicycle ambulances â€” We found one of the major difficulties for people
      reaching one of our two free government clinics, was the lack of
      transport. We have introduced bicycle ambulances in our area. The
      community are trained on the maintenance and recording of the use of the
      bicycle. Transaid have helped with training and assessments over the years
      and also donated money for 2 of the latest installed bicycles.

      Although we aim to build sustainable communities and projects,

## A Child is Born

One of our big forthcoming projects is to build a Waiting Home for new mothers at the Maternity Unit. Watch the Safe Maternal Care video below to see exactly why we built the Maternity Unit in the first place. This second stage will provide essential care for pre-term births - which are higher in Malawi than anywhere else in the world.

The project will include nutritional permaculture gardens in front of the new wing, and education on good nutrition for new mothers.

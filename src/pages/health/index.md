## A Child is Born

One of our big forthcoming projects is to build a Waiting Home for new mothers at the Maternity Unit. Watch the Safe Maternal Care video below to see exactly why we built the Maternity Unit in the first place. This second stage will provide essential care for pre-term births - which are higher in Malawi than anywhere else in the world.

The project will include nutritional permaculture gardens in front of the new wing, and education on good nutrition for new mothers. You can donate here:

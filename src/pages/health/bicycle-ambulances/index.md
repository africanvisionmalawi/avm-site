This project helps to ensure that people can get to a health service. In our area of support there is a huge issue with lack of transport to hospital/clinics.

There are two small Health Centres in our area and they serve a catchment area of 45,000 people!

Because of the lack of health services in our area people have to travel vast distances to be seen by a nurse or doctor. Travel to the clinics is usually by ox and cart but this is an expensive and slow mode of transport. 1 in 6 women die in childbirth, these bicycle ambulances will help save many lives.

We initiated a project to build bicycle ambulances and to provide training to the people in each area so more people can make their way to a health centre.
Bicycle Ambulance

The project started back in May 2010 when Dave Hones spent 3 months out in Malawi working on getting 3 bicycle ambulances made and installed into our villages. The process included:

1. Researching the current situation and writing a report

2. Finding the best place to build the bicycle ambulances

3. Ensuring they were built correctly

4. Setting up the training for use and maintenance of the bicycle ambulances

Victor from Transaid in Zambia came and delivered the training.
Bicycle Ambulance Training

In subsequent years we have raised money for further bicycle ambulances. They cost Â£400 for the bike and training.

6,000 library books have travelled across the high seas and arrived safely at M'teza Library in Sam's Village.  Chikondi and Irene have started unpacking and shelving them.

Organised by Noel Hayes, it is wonderful to have more books for the library.  They will be a wonderful resource for the community.

Thank you to every single person who helped make this happen!

We are looking forward to having volunteer Jenny join us in Sam's Village very soon.  She will be promoting the Library facilities around our area, as well as teaching English at M'teza school.

Great news, the first part of the journey of the bicycle ambulances is the manufacture and delivery to our office in Lilongwe; this is now happening.  We shall be preparing the communities for their use and arranging for training before passing the bicycles on.

Many thanks for contributing to this very worthwhile project and saving lives.

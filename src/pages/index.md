  people in Malawi, one of the poorest countries in the world. Our vision is to see
  a healthy, educated and self-sufficient community in Malawi.

  excerpt: Sam’s Training Village is a self-sustaining training village, built on
    a 17-acre site. The construction phase is now almost complete and the objective
    is to support a move away from hand-outs and to create self-sufficient training
    programmes that can support thousands of local people. This will improve their
    lives in terms of creating employment, organic farming, orphan support, reforestation,
    HIV prevention and many other important areas.

  excerpt: One of our big forthcoming projects is to build a Waiting Home for new
    mothers at the Maternity Unit. This second stage will provide essential care for
    pre-term births - which are higher in Malawi than anywhere else in the world.
    The project will include nutritional permaculture gardens in front of the new
    wing, and education on good nutrition for new mothers.

    Today, many of Malawi’s poorest and most marginalised people don’t have clean water to drink, decent toilets or good hygiene. Without these basics, we cannot begin to help them with better education, health and self-sufficiency.

    45,000 people in our area need clean, safe water. With your help we can ensure that everyone in our area has access to clean, safe water.

  excerpt: We all know our immune systems depend on good nutrition. In Malawi people
    depend on their maize harvest to the exclusion of many highly-nutritious foods.
    Deforestation on a massive scale leads to Malawi losing about 300km2 of forest
    land every year. Help us to spread the message as we teach schools how to create
    vegetable gardens and plant hundreds of trees.

    Most fundraising comes from personal donations.

    You can help us through regular monthly donations; leaving a legacy;
    pledging gifts from a birthday or anniversary; or running a fundraising event.
    Please consider one or more of those as it’s so easy to help.

Regrettably our 2 bike rides in Malawi have been postponed until next year and our UNESCO activities cancelled. With most of our Fundraising cut back this year, do consider supporting us by a small standing order. We have cut back most of our field activities so that we can minimise the effect on our staff and the most vulnerable, but do please help if you can by Donating above. Thank you!

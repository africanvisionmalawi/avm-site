This month we celebrate World Environment Day, June 5th 2020. Do read all about it here. We wish all our friends and supporters good health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Heather is staying in Malawi during this period to provide support to our communities, as they are especially vulnerable at this time. 

Regrettably our 2 bike rides in Malawi have been postponed until next year and our UNESCO activities cancelled. With most of our Fundraising cancelled this year, do consider supporting us by a small standing order. We have cut back most of our field activities so that we can minimise the effect on our staff and the most vulnerable, but do please help if you can by Donating above. Thank you!

We work in an area 30km away from the capital city, Lilongwe. The area we cover is 400km2 with a local population of 45,000. We support 26 Primary Schools, have just under 3,000 orphans and 300 disabled registered with 2 clinics and 2 maternity units. We work through 14 centres where we have a Local Based Committee of 7 volunteers in each centre who help us see and resolve the issues.

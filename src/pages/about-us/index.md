    linkTitle: How we started
    linkText: I lived in Malawi, as a child, for 10 years, and, for some time, had wanted to go back. I didn’t, however, want to return to Malawi as a tourist. I had been supporting a charity called “Child Survival in Malawi” for some years and contacted them to see if anything could be done to help while I was there

We would like to thank:

All of the individuals and companies who are donors, fundraisers, sponsors and volunteers.

All our regular partners, in Malawi and the UK.

All our [UK partnership schools](/education/school-partnerships/#schools), and especially those who have raised money for their Malawian partnership schools.

Thank you so much to:

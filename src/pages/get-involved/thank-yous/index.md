This page celebrates the friends of African Vision Malawi who have been kind enough to support us in activities in the UK and Malawi. The number of people who help us is growing all the time!

We would like to thank:

All of the individuals and companies who are donors, fundraisers, sponsors and volunteers.

All our regular partners, in Malawi and the UK.

All our [UK partnership schools](/education/school-partnerships/#schools), and especially those who have raised money for their Malawian partnership schools.

Thank you so much to:

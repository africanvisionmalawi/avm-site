You may have heard about our amazing sponsored bike rides through Malawi over the last 2 years. Would you like to join us next year? After incredible cycle rides in 2018 and 2019, we have 2 more planned for 2020. **THIS WILL NOW TAKE PLACE NEXT YEAR 2021, DATES YET TO BE AGREED.** Get inspired by watching the[ 2019 Video here!!](https://vimeo.com/352330947)

Please join in or support us as we cycle 500km through Malawi. We would love to have you join us, but if you can’t, please support our cyclists who are paying all of their costs to participate; your donation (blue button above) will help them raise funds for the charity’s work in Malawi. Every penny goes to help the most marginalised in society in one of the world’s poorest countries. There are 3 optional hike days, 6 cycle days and amongst them, 2 off-days, one on safari, the other by the incredible Lake Malawi. During the cycle ride there is an optional cycle up Zomba Plateau (10km).

£1,350 per person is all inclusive for the cycle ride (accommodation, food, transport, cycle hire, safari) but doesn’t include flights, insurance, hike, vaccinations and visa. We ask you to raise £1,000 which will go towards our projects. There is a [full information pack here](http://www.africanvision.org.uk/africa-vision-news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Pedal-Power-2020-information-pack.pdf) with everything you should need, if you want more or would like to book, contact Heather here …

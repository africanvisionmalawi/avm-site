  linkText: Water is a major issue in our area and was identified by our community
    as one of the highest priorities. Rotary International supported us in 2011 -
    2013 to put in 38 new wells, and further funding is in the pipeline.

45,000 people in our area need clean, safe water.

We have initiated a safe water program and intend to ensure that everyone in our area (around 45,000 people) has access to clean, safe water.

We support 14 centres, each with a number of satellite villages (anything up to 40).

We also build rammed earth water harvesters.

_Did you know?_

When we receive 1mm of rain and it falls on 1square metre of roof/land we get one litre of water? 1mm x1m2=1litre. Malawi gets an annual average rainfall of around 800mm per year. If that rain falls on an average class-room of say 100 square metres, then 80,000 litres of rain can be harvested in one season.
